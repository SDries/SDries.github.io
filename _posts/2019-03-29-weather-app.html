<p>
	This application allows a user to view the observed (in the past 30 days) or forecasted (in the future) daily weather conditions for a given location (the user's current location).
</p>
<p>
	In the interest of continuity I will document all of the technical aspects of the application on the github page.
	Rather, be sure to read the readme files in the source code. There's one file pertaining to the back- and one to the frontend of the application.
</p>
<h2>In summary</h2>
<p>
	Briefly stated, the application works as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The user's location is requested(using the geolocation web API).</li>
	<li>The location data is passed to an express backend on the server.</li>
	<li>This backend will fetch weather data for that location from the <a href="https://darksky.net/dev" target="_blank">dark sky API</a>.</li>
	<li>This weather data is then passed from the backend to the React frontend and displayed to the user.</li>
</ol>
